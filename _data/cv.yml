        - title: Clustering Analysis Integrating Omics data
          contents:
            - Developed a clustering model (LUCID) to uncover the latent clusters by integrating multi-view data and extended LUCID to incorporate missingness in omics data.
            - Proposed an integrated variable selection framework for LUCID, based on L1 penalty.
            - Published and maintained an R package, LUCIDus on CRAN (current version is 2.2.0 with more than 20,000 downloads).
        - title: Applied Data Analysis
          contents:
            - Applied LUCID model to evaluate how prenatal exposure to PFAS associated with increased susceptibility to liver injury in children; created molecular signature for children at high risk of liver injury by using serum metabolomics data.
            - Conducted predictive modeling for Mediterranean diet adherence (KIDMED) and ultra-processed food consumption by using urinary metabolic profiling; evaluated model performance through Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis.

        - title: Independent Read Data Quality Check
          contents: 
            - Collaborated with biostatisticians, clinical scientists and software engineers across different functional groups and developed a pipeline to check quality of Independent Read data.
            - Developed a modularized R Shiny app to implement the proposed pipeline; the app was adopted by 2 clinical trial study teams.
        - title: Automatic Clinical Trial Reporting
          contents:
            - Enhanced EnableRF R package to automatically generate PowerPoint slides for clinical trial report, featuring user-specified content format and automatic pagination for long tables.

    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Mount Sinai, New York, NY
      mentor: Advised by Dr. Xiaoyu Song
      year: 05/2017 - 08/2017
      description:
        - Worked on trans-eQTL identification using data from GTEx; developed a pipeline to analyze gene-SNP pairs among 3 tissues, which decreased the total time of analysis for a single tissue (number of computations larger than 4 time 10 to the power of 10) from more than 3 days to around 8 hours.
