### **LUCID**

**Summary**

Latent Unknown Clustering with Integrated Data (LUCID) is an integrative model to estimate latent unknown clusters using multi-view data (exposure, multiple types of omic data as well as outcome). It aims to both distinguish unique exposure effects and informative omic effects while jointly estimating subgroups of individuals relevant to the outcome of interest.

LUCIDus is an R package to implement the LUCID model. It features model estimation, model selection, model visualization, and inference based on bootstrap resampling. It also incorporates methods to deal with missingness in omics data.

**Software**
1. `LUCIDus`: [code](https://github.com/USCbiostats/LUCIDus); [website](https://uscbiostats.github.io/LUCIDus/index.html)
2. `LUCIDusM`: an extension of LUCID incorporating multiple types of omic data in a parallel fashion. [code](https://github.com/Yinqi93/LUCIDusM)
