Hi there, my name is Zhao, Yinqi (赵胤淇). I'm a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at [University of Souther California](https://pphs.usc.edu/divisions/biostatistics/), advised by [Prof. David V. Conti](https://contilab.usc.edu/). My thesis focuses on developing new tools for integrative clustering analysis of multi-view data. I also collaborate with researchers from [Center for Translational Research on Environmental Health](https://uscrten.usc.edu/) on applied analytics in environmental epidemiology. You can find my resume [here](./assets/pdf/Yinqi_Zhao_resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} (last updated on August, 2022).

I am an R enthuasiast and passionate about developing open-source tools for various statistical methods. Apart from research, you can find me in a random climbing gym around Los Angeles.

I will join [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) as a statistical scientist in Spring, 2023.
